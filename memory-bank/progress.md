[2025-09-06 04:08:27] - Started implementing northern lights background using Three.js. Installed Three.js, created the Astro component, integrated it into the base layout, and adjusted global CSS for transparency.

[2025-09-06 04:15:55] - User reported that the Northern Lights background implementation failed again. User is asking if a GLB file should be provided.

[2025-09-06 04:18:30] - Resolved the 404 error for `northernLights.js` by adjusting the import path in `NorthernLightsThreeJS.astro`. The Northern Lights background is now visible. Removed debugging console logs.

[2025-09-08 01:45:00] - Fixed ProjectsBackground.jsx component by restoring GLTF model loading (space_boi.glb), enhanced caustic-like lighting effects, and improved post-processing with multiple visual effects.

[2025-09-08 01:59:00] - Corrected ProjectsBackground.jsx to use the cartoon_flesh-eating_plant_with_animations.glb model instead of space_boi.glb as requested by the user.

[2025-09-08 02:02:00] - Removed ProjectsBackground component entirely from projects.astro page and cleaned up associated CSS styling as requested by user.

[2025-09-08 02:03:00] - Deleted the unused ProjectsBackground.jsx file to clean up codebase as requested by user.
