[2025-09-06 04:08:27] - Started implementing northern lights background using Three.js. Installed Three.js, created the Astro component, integrated it into the base layout, and adjusted global CSS for transparency.

[2025-09-06 04:15:55] - User reported that the Northern Lights background implementation failed again. User is asking if a GLB file should be provided.

[2025-09-06 04:18:30] - Resolved the 404 error for `northernLights.js` by adjusting the import path in `NorthernLightsThreeJS.astro`. The Northern Lights background is now visible. Removed debugging console logs.
